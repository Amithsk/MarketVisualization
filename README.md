# MarketVisualization
The goal of this project is to provide a single control interface where market participants can analyze data patterns, compare actual vs predicted performance, and make more informed trading or portfolio decisions through clear, interactive visualizations

#Key Objectives

Consolidation — unify ETF, intraday, and prediction data under one visualization layer.

Visualization — provide dashboards for performance tracking, gainers/losers, circuit hits, liquidity, and AI predictions.

Traceability — ensure every metric is traceable to a database field (no black-box visuals).

Interactivity — enable drill-downs, filtering, and cross-dashboard comparisons.

Insight Generation — integrate ML/AI-driven predictions, error tracking, and confidence metrics.

Audit & Monitoring — visualize pipeline ingestion health, missing data, and update freshness.
