PROJECT INSTRUCTION DOCUMENT
Intraday Market Context & Decision UI
1️⃣ PROJECT NAME

Intraday Market Context & Decision Dashboard (UI Only)

2️⃣ PROJECT PURPOSE

This project exists only to design and iterate on the USER INTERFACE (UI) for capturing:

STEP 1 — Market Context (Pre-Market)

STEP 2 — Market Open Behavior

End-of-Day Review

The UI is meant to:

Help a trader input data cleanly

Reduce cognitive load

Encourage consistency & discipline

Make daily review easy

🚫 This project must NOT:

Implement calculations

Write backend logic

Handle databases or APIs

Decide market state automatically

All calculations and logic will be handled outside this project.

3️⃣ CORE UI PHILOSOPHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

The UI should be designed with these principles:

Form-driven, not chart-driven

Minimal inputs, maximum clarity

Explicit decision recording

Friction for impulsive trading

Optimized for daily repetition

The UI should feel like a professional trading checklist, not a trading app.

4️⃣ TARGET USER

Single discretionary intraday trader

Uses NIFTY 50 as market context

Wants to learn and refine judgment

Will fill this UI daily, manually

Wants to review past days for patterns

5️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL UI STRUCTURE

The UI must be divided into 4 clear sections, preferably in this order:

A. Header & Session Info
B. STEP 1 — Market Context (Pre-Market)
C. STEP 2 — Market Open Behavior
D. Review & Reflection (End of Day)


Each section should be visually separated.
